Simple topology with 1 UDP client and 1 UDP server connected in one OpenFlow-enabled switch.
The controller requests flow-statistics every 30sec.

The simulation has 250 seconds duration.
[General] configuration simulates normal conditions within the network where no attacks are present.

[Simple_Attack] configuration simulates a compromised client that floods the server with fake packets. 
The attack starts at simulation time 90s and its description is presented in the 'simple_attack.adl'. 

[Disable] configuration simulates the disable of the server and the nodes dissapears from the simulation field when the attack is executed.

Extend the configurations by adding your own attack descriptions. Describe the attack in an '.adl' file and convert the file to a '.xml' by running the interperter under the command
'../../../interpreter/interpreter/interpreter.py -i inputFile.adl -o outputFile.xml'
